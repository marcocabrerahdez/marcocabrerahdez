# Hi there! 👋 I'm Marco Cabrera

**Machine Learning Engineer** at Nartex Software and former **Junior AI Researcher** at the University of La Laguna. Passionate about taking AI models to production—from RAG pipelines to full-scale MLOps.

## 👨‍💻 About Me
- 🌟 Leading a **RAG pipeline** with Transformers & FAISS for document classification (93% accuracy).  
- 🚀 Building **ETL pipelines** with Airflow, processing millions of records daily.  
- 🤖 Developed a **CNN** in TensorFlow/Keras for defect detection (94% validation accuracy).  
- 🐳 Docker & Kubernetes: deployed inference microservices, cutting deployment time by 60%.  
- 📈 MLOps: Prometheus, Grafana, MLflow & Optuna for monitoring, drift detection & automated tuning.  
- 🧪 Co-author of a paper on **surrogate models** for clinical decision support in T1DM, published in *Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine*.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
- **Languages:** Python (NumPy, Pandas), SQL  
- **Machine Learning:** Transformers, FAISS, CNNs (TensorFlow/Keras)  
- **MLOps:** Airflow, Docker, Kubernetes, MLflow, Optuna, Prometheus, Grafana, Feast  
- **Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS, React  
- **Blogging:** MDX, remark-gfm, rehype-highlight  

## 📂 Featured Projects
- **RAG Pipeline for Legal Docs**  
  Document classification with Transformers + FAISS (93% accuracy).  
- **Surrogate Models for T1DM**  
  Replaced complex HTA models with ML surrogate models (IoU > 0.9, 2700× faster).
